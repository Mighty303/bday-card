        I felt too lazy to make a card so I made this instead. I am really glad I met you even if we haven't been friends for long (doesn't feel like it either).
        Thank you for listening to me yap about life, 295. and about the most randomest things especially when we connect about our mental disabilityðŸ¤¡.
        It's been really fun talking to you and I hope we can continue to be friends for a long time.
        Even though I haven't known you for long, you've been a great friend to me and really inspired me to improve myself.
